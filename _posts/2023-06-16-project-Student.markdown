### As a Student
<img src="img/Umich/umich.jpeg" alt="DMA Image" style="width: 600px; height: auto;"><br>
<p>Not only am I focused on academic and technical growth, but I am also thoroughly enjoying my experience at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The campus atmosphere is vibrant and diverse, allowing me to meet and connect with students from various backgrounds who share a common passion for learning and innovation. Building these friendships and connections not only enriches my university experience but also opens doors to collaboration and networking opportunities within and beyond my field of study.

Being a proud Wolverine, I embrace the traditions and spirit of the university, taking part in campus events, supporting our athletic teams, and immersing myself in the rich cultural and social offerings. The sense of community and pride is contagious, and it fuels my motivation to excel academically and professionally. As a student at the University of Michigan, I am grateful for the well-rounded education I am receiving, the supportive network of peers and faculty, and the unique experiences that come with being a part of this prestigious institution.</p><br>

### GEECS Member

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in clubs and organizations at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, which offer me valuable opportunities for personal and professional growth. During my first year, I joined GEECS (Girls in Electrical and Computer Science), a club dedicated to empowering and supporting women in STEM fields. Through GEECS, I gained insights into the challenges women face in the tech industry and developed a deeper understanding of the importance of diversity and inclusion. Engaging in organized activities and internship panels provided me with practical advice, expanded my network, and introduced me to professionals and fellow students from diverse majors. These connections not only broadened my perspectives but also fostered a supportive community that encourages collaboration and learning.

As I enter my sophomore year, I am excited to further expand my involvement in clubs and organizations that align with my interests and aspirations. I recognize that joining additional clubs will allow me to explore different aspects of technology, engage with like-minded individuals, and broaden my skill set. By actively participating in these clubs, I will have the opportunity to take on leadership roles, collaborate on projects, and further develop important soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. I am confident that the diverse experiences and connections I will gain from joining more clubs during my sophomore year will not only enhance my university experience but also contribute to my personal and professional development as I prepare for a successful career in the tech industry.</p><br>

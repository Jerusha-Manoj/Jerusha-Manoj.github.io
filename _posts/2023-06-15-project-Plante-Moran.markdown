description: Currently interning at Plante Moran, I am actively involved in various projects utilizing Agile methodologies. In Project 1, I am tasked with creating a deliverable for a periodic user assessment. This involves managing a list of asset allocations and developing a system that sends out periodic emails to specific individuals, prompting them to perform assessments on their assets. I am dedicated to ensuring the user-friendliness and convenience of the product for both the sender and receiver of the emails. Regularly meeting with my supervisor, I actively seek feedback and implement solutions to improve the project. In Project 2, I have taken the lead in organizing and executing the firm's security awareness month campaign. This involves engaging and educating a large staff of over 3,000 individuals on various cyber security threats. Through informative sessions and proactive initiatives, I aim to raise awareness and promote a culture of security within the organization. Additionally, in Project 3, I am contributing to enhancing the firm's security practices as part of the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) team. This involves actively participating in meetings, shadowing experienced professionals, and completing assessment work to gain valuable insights into SOC 2 compliance. Throughout my internship, my primary goal is to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of Cyber Security while making valuable contributions to the company. I am eager to learn, actively seek opportunities for growth, and contribute to the overall success of the organization.

description: During my internship at DTE as a data analyst, I completed three projects. The first project involved creating a PowerApp app to organize, filter, insert, and delete licenses within a SharePoint list. It took approximately one month to complete. Using Agile methodologies, I presented my prototype app to my supervisor on a weekly basis and incorporated feedback into the development process. The goal was to leverage the features of PowerApps to provide a convenient solution for managing licenses. I connected the PowerApp to the SharePoint list and DTE's active directory, allowing easy lookup of names, job titles, and emails. The app enabled users to select licenses from a dropdown and provided filtering options based on expiration dates, license types, keywords, and names. Additionally, it included buttons for editing and deleting entries, with pop-up notifications to prevent accidental deletions or duplicates. The success of this project led to another opportunity.In project two, my supervisor was impressed with my work on the first project and asked me to create a similar PowerApp app but focused on password management. Using a separate SharePoint list dedicated to company-issued passwords, I enhanced the app with additional features, including password hiding and restricted access to authorized personnel only. This project also took approximately one month to complete.Lastly, project three involved creating a Power BI dashboard using the same SharePoint list from project one. The goal was to provide visually appealing and informative insights into license allocation within the company. The Power BI dashboard showcased details such as expired licenses and the percentage of each license type used by the company. I paid attention to color choices, considering colorblind users. This project further strengthened my skills with Microsoft platforms.Overall, these projects allowed me to deliver high-level requirements, adhere to Agile methodologies, and become proficient in PowerApps and Power BI. The solutions I developed provided valuable insights for license allocation, improved management processes, streamlined operations, and enhanced security for company-issued licenses and passwords at DTE.

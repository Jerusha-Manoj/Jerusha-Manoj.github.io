description: As a sophomore at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Engineering with a major in Computer Science. My journey at the university has been fulfilling and exciting, filled with opportunities for growth and exploration. During my first year, I joined GEECS (Girls in Electrical and Computer Science), a club specifically tailored to empower and support women in STEM fields. Through my involvement in GEECS, I actively participated in various organized activities that provided valuable knowledge and insights into the challenges women face in the field. It was an eye-opening experience that further deepened my understanding of gender disparities and the importance of diversity in the tech industry. I took advantage of internship panels organized by the club, which offered valuable opportunities to enhance my understanding of company expectations and gain insight into the hiring process. These panels not only provided me with practical advice but also allowed me to expand my network by connecting with professionals and fellow students from diverse majors. Building these connections has been instrumental in broadening my perspectives and fostering a supportive community. As I embark on my sophomore year, I am eager to further enrich my university experience. I have plans to join additional clubs that align with my interests and aspirations, allowing me to explore different aspects of technology and engage with like-minded individuals. Additionally, I am motivated to rush for professional fraternities, as they provide an excellent platform for building technical skills and expanding my network within the field. Throughout my time at the University of Michigan, I am committed to not only excelling academically but also actively seeking opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. By immersing myself in various experiences, clubs, and networking opportunities, I aim to build a strong foundation of technical skills and establish meaningful connections that will benefit me throughout my career.My first year at the university was truly amazing, and I am excited to continue my journey as a proud Wolverine. Go Blue!

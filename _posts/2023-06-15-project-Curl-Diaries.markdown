### How I started
<p>Curl-Diaries is my passion project, born out of a strong desire to empower and celebrate curly hair. It all started when I shared a TikTok video showcasing my own curly hair routine, and the overwhelming response and flood of questions I received made me realize the influence I held. Motivated by my love for technology and the desire to help more people, I decided to establish Curl-Diaries as a blog for reviewing curly hair products, sharing my experiences, recommendations, and insights. Through my TikTok platform and interactive community, I have been able to connect with and support individuals on their curly hair journeys, providing practical tips and guidance. The primary objective of Curl-Diaries is to encourage individuals to embrace and celebrate their natural curls, and I am committed to utilizing my platform to continue empowering the curly hair community.</p><br>

By customizing these files to suit my needs and make the project align with my vision, I gained a deeper understanding of the platform's structure and familiarized myself with essential GitHub terms. As a beginner, this served as a solid foundation for my understanding of GitHub, and I am excited to continue growing and expanding my skills on this platform as I further develop Curl-Diaries.</p><br>

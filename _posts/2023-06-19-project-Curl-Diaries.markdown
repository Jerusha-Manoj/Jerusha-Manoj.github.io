description: Blog: [https://jerusha-manoj.github.io/curlyhairblog/] | TikTok: [@_curl_diaries_]                                         Curl-Diaries, a blog dedicated to promoting curly hair embracement, was created using GitHub. As a first-time user of the platform, I took the opportunity to learn and explore its features, gaining valuable insights into GitHub and its capabilities. The journey of Curl-Diaries began when I shared a TikTok video showcasing my curly hair routine, which quickly gained traction and received an impressive 127k likes. The overwhelming response and the flood of questions I received about the products I used and how I maintained my hair made me realize the influence I held. Driven by my passion for technology and the desire to help more people, I decided to establish Curl-Diaries. Curl-Diaries serves as a platform for reviewing curly hair products, where I share my experiences, recommendations, and insights. In addition, I continued to utilize my TikTok platform to demonstrate how I maintain my curly hair, providing practical tips and engaging with my audience. The primary objective of Curl-Diaries is to encourage individuals to embrace and celebrate their natural curls. Through TikTok, I have been able to generate significant engagement, amassing a dedicated community of 10,600 followers and accumulating an impressive 420,000 likes. This interactive community has become a space where people connect, share their experiences, and seek advice about curly hair. The blog, in particular, has been instrumental in addressing people's questions about the products that worked for me and offering recommendations based on my personal experiences. It is incredibly fulfilling to hear from individuals who express how my guidance has helped them embrace and love their curly hair. Moving forward, I am committed to utilizing my platform and continuing my efforts to assist and empower the curly hair community.
